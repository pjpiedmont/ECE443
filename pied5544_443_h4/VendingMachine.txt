Vending Maching Application Lesson 2

This application is a modified version of WebVend demonstration 
program supplied with the Microchip Applications library.  The
differences are found in the fact that all references to 
processors other than the PIC32MX7 and compilesr other than C32
have been removed.  This application has been specifically
targeted to the Digilent Cerebot 32MX7ck development board that
is equipped to the PModCLP LCD connected to the board JB and JC
PMod connectors

The original WebVend application was presented in a series
of three Microchip Webinars that progressively developed the
web interfaces used in this version of the application.

The operations of this application has been modified to 
accomodate 3 button control where as the oribinal code used
four buttons. The operations are now as follows:

1. BTN1 - Shift selection right
2. BTN2 - Shift selection left
3. BTN3 - make selection
4  BTN2 & BTN3 - add $0.25 to coin box.

CFG_INCLUDE_PIC32_ETH_SK_ETH795 must be defined in the project 
built options for the MPLAB PIC32 Assembler and the PIC32 C
Compiler.

The Directory must show the following paths for the include
search path:
.
configs
..\..\Microchip\Include

The device IP address is set in the File TCPIP ETH795.h


Full functionality tested on 12/10/2012
