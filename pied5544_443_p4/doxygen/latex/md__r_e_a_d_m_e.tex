Demonstrates the use of Free\+R\+T\+OS task scheduling and interrupt handling. Receives messages from U\+A\+R\+T1, stores them in an I2C E\+E\+P\+R\+OM, retrieves them from the E\+E\+P\+R\+OM, and prints them to an L\+CD. Uses the U\+A\+R\+T1 RX interrupt to receive individual characters from U\+A\+R\+T1. Passes them through a queue to a task, which stores them in the E\+E\+P\+R\+OM. When B\+T\+N1 is pressed, another task will read from the E\+E\+P\+R\+OM and display the message on the L\+CD, breaking lines in nice places and scrolling upward. L\+E\+DA and L\+E\+DB indicate whether the E\+E\+P\+R\+OM can be written to or read from, and L\+E\+DC acts as a \char`\"{}heartbeat\char`\"{} to assess timings.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Author}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
